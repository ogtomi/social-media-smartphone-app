# social-media-smartphone-app
Social media app written in React Native. App requires connection to database which was created using postgresql.
Application's main goal is to pair users who participate in the same events nearby (tinderlike- users swipe right to like a person and left to reject). Once paired users are allow to text each other, create new events and add posts to their walls.

Users can also personalize their profiles: change profile photos, personal information, description etc.
